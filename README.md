## Description
This is a port of my JukeBox App `Craigs Music Player` to run just using JS. The original app uses PHP for some if its logic. This port negates the use of PHP to fetch
files in favour of JSON. While, the project is incomplete for full-fledged UI. The JSON logic and add-to-queue function works.

# Usage
- clone
- In your terminal, `npm i`
- `npm run dev`
